default capacity 11
default loadFactor 0.75




Constructor	
Hashtable()	It creates an empty hashtable having the initial default capacity and load factor.
Hashtable(int capacity)	It accepts an integer parameter and creates a hash table that contains a specified initial capacity.
Hashtable(int capacity, float loadFactor)	It is used to create a hash table having the specified initial capacity and loadFactor.
Hashtable(Map m)	It creates a new hash table with the same mappings as the given Map.
