Vector Class 

package : java.util package 

Vector is like the dynamic array which can 
grow or shrink its size.

new size = (3/2 * old size) +1
specify our own increment value (15)
default size 10 25 50 65

Legacy class
depracate 



It is Synchronized(Multi-threading)
It Contains legacy methods(which are not a part of
Collection Framework anymore)

Unlike array, we can store n-number of 
elements in it as there is no size limit. 

It is a part of Java Collection framework 
since Java 1.2. --java 14

It is found in the java.util package 

It implements the List interface, 
so we can use all the methods of List interface here.





1)	Vector()	It constructs an empty vector with the default capacity as 10.
2)	Vector(int initialCapacity)	It constructs an empty vector with the specified initial capacity and with its capacity increment equal to zero.
3)	Vector(int initialCapacity, int capacityIncrement)	It constructs an empty vector with the specified initial capacity and capacity increment.
4)	Vector( Collection c)	It constructs a vector that contains the elements of a collection c.



methods
addElement() same as add() - add at last place
insertElementAt(Object, index) - insert any position
				("Alice",2)
elementAt(int index)  same as get(index)
					ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException- This method has thrown an exception if the index is out of range i.e. index < 0 || index >= size().

firstElement() - return the first element
lastElement() - return the first element

removeElement() - removes first element
removeElementAt(int index) - remove any position
