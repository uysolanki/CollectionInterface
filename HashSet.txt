HashSet

Java HashSet class is used to create a collection 
that uses a hash table for storage. 
It inherits the AbstractSet class and 
implements Set interface.


HashSet stores the elements by using a mechanism 
called hashing.

HashSet contains unique elements only.

HashSet allows maximum one null value .

HashSet class is non synchronized.

HashSet doesn't maintain the insertion order. 
Here, elements are inserted on the basis of their 
hashcode.

HashSet is the best approach for search operations.
The initial default capacity of HashSet is 16, 
and the load factor(fill ratio) is 0.75.



Constructor	
1)	HashSet()	It is used to construct a default HashSet.
2)	HashSet(int capacity)	It is used to initialize the capacity of the hash set to the given integer value capacity. The capacity grows automatically as elements are added to the HashSet.
3)	HashSet(int capacity, float loadFactor)	It is used to initialize the capacity of the hash set to the given integer value capacity and the specified load factor.
4)	HashSet(Collection c)	It is used to initialize the hash set by using the elements of the collection c.
