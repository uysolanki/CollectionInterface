package :  java.util.TreeSet

TreeSet inherits AbstractSet
implements the NavigableSet,Cloneable,Serializable 


The objects of the TreeSet class are stored in 
ascending order.

Constructor
TreeSet()	It is used to construct an empty tree set that will be sorted in ascending order according to the natural order of the tree set.
default size,defualt sorting order(asc)
TreeSet(Collection c)	It is used to build a new tree set that contains the elements of the collection c.
TreeSet(Comparator comp)	It is used to construct an empty tree set that will be sorted according to given comparator.
user defined sorting order
TreeSet(SortedSet  ss)	It is used to build a TreeSet that contains the elements of the given SortedSet.


Methods

Object higher(Object o)	It returns the closest greatest element of the specified element from the set, or null there is no such element.
Object lower(Object o)	It returns the closest least element of the specified element from the set, or null there is no such element.
Object pollFirst()	It is used to retrieve and remove the lowest(first) element.
Object pollLast()	It is used to retrieve and remove the highest(last) element.
Object first()	It returns the first (lowest) element currently in this sorted set.
Object last()	It returns the last (highest) element currently in this sorted set.
int size()	It returns the number of elements in this set.
